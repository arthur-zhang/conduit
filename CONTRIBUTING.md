2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the development environment (see below)
4. Create a branch for your changes
5. Make your changes and test them
6. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.70+** - Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- **At least one supported agent:**
  - [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) (`claude` binary)
  - [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) (`codex` binary)

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/conduit.git
cd conduit

# Build in debug mode
cargo build

# Build in release mode
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run the application
cargo run
```

### Website Development

The website is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/):

```bash
cd website
npm install
npm run dev    # Start dev server at http://localhost:4321
npm run build  # Build for production
```

## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

- **Bug fixes** - Fix issues reported in the issue tracker
- **Features** - Implement new functionality
- **Documentation** - Improve docs, README, or inline comments
- **Tests** - Add or improve test coverage
- **Refactoring** - Code improvements without changing functionality

### Before You Start

1. Check existing [issues](https://github.com/conduit-cli/conduit/issues) to see if your idea has been discussed
2. For significant changes, open an issue first to discuss your approach
3. For small fixes, you can submit a PR directly

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a descriptive branch name:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```

2. **Make your changes:**
   - Write clear, concise commit messages
   - Keep commits focused and atomic
   - Reference issue numbers in commits when applicable

3. **Test your changes:**
   ```bash
   cargo test
   cargo clippy -- -D warnings
   cargo fmt --check
   ```

4. **Update documentation** if your changes affect user-facing behavior

5. **Submit the PR:**
   - Fill out the PR template completely
   - Link any related issues
   - Request review from maintainers

6. **Respond to feedback:**
   - Address review comments promptly
   - Push additional commits as needed
   - Maintainers may request changes before merging

## Code Style

### Rust

- Follow the [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/)
- Use `cargo fmt` to format code
- Use `cargo clippy` to catch common mistakes
- Write descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

### TypeScript/JavaScript (Website)

- Use TypeScript where possible
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use meaningful component and function names

### General

- Keep functions focused and small
- Prefer explicit over implicit behavior
- Write self-documenting code when possible
- Add comments for "why", not "what"

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run a specific test
cargo test test_name

# Run tests for a specific module
cargo test module_name::
```

### Writing Tests

- Add unit tests for new functions
- Add integration tests for new features
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested

## Reporting Bugs
