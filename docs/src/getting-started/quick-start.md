# Quick Start

Get up and running with Conduit in 5 minutes.

## Start Conduit

```bash
conduit
```

You'll see the main interface with a sidebar on the left and an empty chat area.

## Open a Project

1. Press `Ctrl+N` to open the project picker
   On first run, you will first select enabled providers, then continue.
2. Type to filter your recent repositories
3. Press `Enter` to select one, or `Ctrl+A` to add a new repository

A new tab opens with your project loaded.

## Send a Prompt

1. Type your message in the input box at the bottom
2. Press `Enter` to send
3. Watch the agent work — you'll see tool executions and responses in real-time

## Essential Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+N` | New project/tab |
| `Alt+1-9` | Switch to tab 1-9 |
| `Tab` | Toggle Build/Plan mode |
| `Ctrl+T` | Toggle sidebar |
| `Ctrl+P` | Command palette |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Quit |

## Open Multiple Tabs

Run multiple agents simultaneously:

1. Press `Ctrl+N` to open another project
2. Use `Alt+1`, `Alt+2`, etc. to switch between tabs
3. Or use `Alt+Tab` / `Alt+Shift+Tab` to cycle through

Each tab runs independently — you can have Claude working on one task while Codex handles another.

## Toggle Build/Plan Mode

Press `Tab` to switch between:

- **Build Mode** (default) — Agent can read, write, and execute commands
- **Plan Mode** — Read-only analysis, no modifications

The status bar shows the current mode.

Plan mode relies on prompt guidance for Codex and Gemini, so treat it as best-effort.

## View Token Usage

The status bar displays:
- Input/output token counts
- Estimated cost
- Current model

Toggle the display in settings or with `Alt+P`.
