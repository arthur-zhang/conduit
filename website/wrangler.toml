# Cloudflare Pages configuration for getconduit.sh
name = "getconduit-sh"

# Deployment command: pnpm deploy
# This will build and deploy to Cloudflare Pages
#
# Note: Production branch is configured in Cloudflare Dashboard.
# All deployments via wrangler go live to getconduit.sh automatically
# since the project has no git integration (direct upload mode).
